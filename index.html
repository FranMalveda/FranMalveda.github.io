<p>
The modern age has seen great advances in the development in technology and the ways it can be used to enrich the lives of all. However, the topic of digital surveillance - defined by the deliberate and consistent focus on personal information fueled by clear intent (Lyon, 2015) - raises numerous concerns. 
A breach of public safety is often cause for the government to employ greater observation over the populace and defend against crime, but balancing the public’s well-being alongside its rights to privacy is a topic of great tension (Baecker, 2019).
This tension is seen in the United States of America due to its volatile state of politics and crime, and its history of increasing surveillance in response to 9/11. 
An example of such tension has been seen in early 2016, where a confrontation took place between the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) and Apple Incorporated. 
The latter refused to unlock a convicted mass shooter’s phone at the F.B.I.’s request - wanting to gain insight into the motives behind the convict’s crime - due to their own privacy policies (Baecker, 2019). 
In our personal opinion as a group, the idea of losing one’s privacy and the potential for misuse of personal information is a daunting one. 
Thus, given these thoughts and the rich amount of history and discussion surrounding these topics, our group has elected to make loss of privacy due to digital surveillance in the USA our primary focus.
