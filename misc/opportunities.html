<p>
In terms of benefitting society at large, investigation and gathering of data is known to be carried out by law enforcement primarily to avert potential future events (Cayford & Pieters, 2018). These actions become prevalent in the age of modern terrorism, with law enforcement employing these surveillance methods with the intention of preventing terrorist attacks and dismantling terrorist groups in advance. According to National Security Agency director General Alexander, information collected via surveillance had led to the interruption of 54 terrorist activities in accordance with national laws. These numbers stand out when placed next to American statistics in which 2022 saw a 39% rise in crime rates compared to 2021, with an average rate of 47.70 and a peak of 6.53 million in property crimes (Cover, 2016).
