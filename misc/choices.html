<p>
In view of the fact that digital surveillance has risks of breaching individual information and surveillance abuse there are choices available that can help mitigate these risks such as General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) it is the most resilient privacy security law in the world that was drafted and passed by the European Union (Ben Wolford - EUâ€™s data protection law). It imposes strict requirements on organisations handling personal data, including obtaining consent, providing data breach notifications and ensuring transparency. Similar to GDPR, in the US of California also have enacted a privacy act called California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which provides an extensive and organised analysis of the CCPA into concrete practical components, it produces a structured guide that equips businesses and practitioners with the required tools needed to understand the data collected and how it being used, furthermore allows users to opt out of data sharing and gives rights to request deletion of their personal data (Scott W. Pink - California Consumer Privacy Act Annotated).

Mass Surveillance can grant a sense of power and dominance however it can potentially lead to misuse and surveillance abuse. Establishing strong legal protections can limit surveillance powers and ensure that laws require proper oversight and accountability mechanisms for surveillance activities. Also initialising independent oversight bodies with the power to review and monitor surveillance activities having authority to assess certain surveillance operations and investigate complaints to ensure transparency (David Lyon - State and Surveillance).
