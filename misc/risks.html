<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><p>
Digital surveillance has been a widely debated topic throughout the years and has gained more infamy during the present time due to the prominence and expansion of the digital technology industry. Although digital surveillance can be a useful tool for digital security, it also raises many controversies due to its encroaching nature. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
This inherent nature has made the risk of privacy infringement really significant. Privacy infringement has become a problem in many countries, more notably the US. Privacy infringement is a risk that comes from digital surveillance because privacy needs to be bypassed in order to attain the information needed to surveil. This infringes on a citizen’s privacy. Privacy such as their personal information, and their activities. All this stored data is subject to the potential for data breaches, (CERT NZ, n.d.) which is “when private and confidential information is released into an unsecured environment. This usually means that the information becomes publicly available. It also means others can use it for personal gain, or to cause harm to an individual.” The collection of this personal data other than being subject to data breaches also creates a worrying potential for unauthorised access and misuse which leads to more problems such as identity theft, financial fraud, and reputational damage (Baecker, 2019).
</p>
<br>
<p>
Another risk that is involved with digital surveillance is surveillance abuse. The abuse of digital surveillance technologies can come in many forms such as spying, blackmail, and other forms of intimidation and control. Surveillance abuse is free to be used by anyone that has the knowledge and means to do so, which is becoming an increasing problem due to the growing number of devices which is growing at a rate relative to how many people are on this planet. As more people are born and the population increases, it is obvious that we would need more devices which explains the steady increase of this statistic. There are many instances of surveillance abuse in countries such as the US. Such examples of these data breaches in the US include a breach of Facebook’s data stores in a 50 million person wide harvest in order to create a software that would predict and influence choices at the ballot box (Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach). Another example would be the Equifax Data Breach. Equifax is a credit reporting agency based in Atlanta and in 2017, suffered a data breach. This data breach resulted in hackers stealing personal data of over 146.6 million consumers. The data stolen included names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, etc… ( " I've Got Nothing to Lose": Consumers' Risk Perceptions and Protective Actions after the Equifax Data Breach. In SOUPS@ USENIX Security Symposium (pp. 197-216).
