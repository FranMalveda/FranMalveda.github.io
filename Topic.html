    <h2>Topic: Loss of Privacy Due to Digital Surveillance in the U.S.A.</h2>

	<!-- p contains the main body paragraph/s -->
	
<p>
	In the United States of America with a population of over 329 million; statistics reveal that the crime rate in the year 2022 is 47.70 which is 39% higher than the previous year with property crime peaking at 6.53 million offences. As the evolution of technology enhances our society for the better, digital surveillance can be a prime example with its ability to monitor activity and transfer data through various digital networks, it is often treated as a concept of substantial alarm and sometimes moral panic (Cover, 2016). Terrorism is a common concern amongst Americans, following the 9/11 attack US government took quick action to develop a security framework to protect citizens. The Patriot Act was shortly passed and signed by President George W. Bush in October 2011, a law that expanded the search and surveillance powers of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. The analysis of digital surveillance throughout the past couple of decades has increased in importance as a tool for solving crimes and preparing for court cases. (Jackson, 2014). Law enforcement relies extensively on digital evidence for information about both victims and suspects as it helps strengthen circumstantial cases. Because technology is a main source of connection in modern society current devices serve as huge repositories of personal information yet be carried in a back pocket. Law enforcements can utilise digital surveillance to access information prevalent to their case. Surveillance in many places gives people a sense of security and peace of mind for obvious reasons such as theft or preventing fraud, it is also important in providing context and understanding in any given situation. It may also be used to ensure compliance with company policies or regulations within a workplace.

	Despite the fact that digital surveillance benefits society in many aspects, there are also risks associated with digital surveillance. Specifically how it goes against laws that protect privacy, freedom of speech and human rights. Countries such as Norway, Switzerland and Canada have adequate safeguards succeeding at protecting freedom of speech, limits on data sharing and actively enforcing privacy rights with Federal Act on Data Protection. But the situation in the United States is more confrontational in comparison due to being a continuous heavy target of terrorism (Baecker, 2019). As a result the US government needed to take action which included internet surveillance that violates people’s right to privacy. The challenge is trying to maintain the balance between security and privacy by proper regulation and oversight that are necessary to prevent misuse of surveillance powers and to ensure transparency surveillance. Furthermore, another challenge pointed out is that surveillance algorithms and data analysis techniques can be flawed leading to bias outcomes. For example facial recognition, Asian and African American people were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men, depending on the particular algorithm and type of search (Harwell, 2019). Native Americans had the highest false-positive rate of all ethnicities according to study. Also women were more likely to be falsely identified than men which has raised a lot of concerns.
